# DATA AND BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE ANALYST
## About Me
In todayâ€™s data-driven world, making informed decisions goes beyond simply collecting numbers, itâ€™s about understanding what the data is saying. As a Data and Business Intelligence Analyst, I specialise in transforming raw data into clear, actionable insights that empower organisations to make smarter, faster decisions.  

With a strong foundation in data interpretation, visualisation, and communication, I bridge the gap between complex datasets and strategic outcomes. My goal is to make data not just accessible, but meaningful, turning numbers into narratives that inform growth, improve efficiency, and support impactful decisions. Whether itâ€™s through cleaning messy datasets, building interactive dashboards, or conducting deep-dive analyses, Iâ€™m passionate about helping teams uncover the stories behind their data and use them to achieve measurable results.

### **What I Do**
**Data Cleaning**
I help businesses turn chaotic, inconsistent data into clean, structured datasets ready for analysis. By eliminating inaccuracies and standardising formats, I ensure your data is reliable and easy to work with, saving you time, improving accuracy, and enabling more confident decision-making.

**Custom and Interactive Dashboards**
I design intuitive, interactive dashboards tailored to your unique needs. Built around key performance indicators (KPIs), these dashboards offer real-time insights into operations, trends, and performance, helping teams monitor what matters and make informed moves, quickly

**Data Analysis and Strategy**
I go beyond surface-level insights to uncover patterns, trends, and opportunities within your data. Using tools like SQL, Python, and Power BI, I deliver comprehensive analyses that support strategic planning and help businesses align their data with their long-term objectives.
Beyond my technical expertise, I have a keen interest in technology policy and information systems. Through research and strategic insights, I aim to contribute to Africa's digital transformation. 

### **Key Highlights of My Experience** <br>

- **Data-Driven Problem Solving Across Industries**  

Throughout my journey as a Data Analyst, Iâ€™ve applied data analytics to uncover insights, solve real-world problems, and support strategic decision-making across a range of domainsâ€”from retail and food services to telecom and crime prevention.

- **Retail & Consumer Analysis â€“ ExpressMart & Quantium Project** <br>
Through projects like ExpressMart Analysis and The Quantium Customer Analytics, I examined large-scale transaction data to understand customer purchasing behaviour, segment users, and identify growth opportunities. These insights were used to improve customer targeting strategies and enhance product placement for better sales outcomes.

- **Restaurant Order Optimisation â€“ Restaurant Order Analysis** <br>
By analysing restaurant order data, I uncovered sales patterns, peak order times, and best-performing items. I developed dashboards and KPIs that helped restaurant managers make more informed decisions about inventory, promotions, and staffing, leading to more efficient operations and improved revenue.

- **Crime Pattern Detection â€“ Vehicle Theft Analysis** <br>
In this project, I worked with publicly available crime datasets to identify geographic hotspots and time-based patterns of vehicle theft. The analysis provided actionable insights that could support law enforcement in resource allocation and public safety campaigns.

- **Customer Retention Strategy â€“ Telecom Customer Churn Analysis** <br>
I conducted a churn analysis for a telecom company using SQL, Python, and Power BI to identify why customers were leaving. I segmented users, built predictive models, and visualised risk groups. The findings helped the company develop proactive retention strategies tailored to high-risk customers, improving customer satisfaction and reducing churn.
